            <p class="animate-text">
                We are a dedicated tree plantation foundation that has successfully crossed the milestone of planting over
                <strong>10 thousand trees, and aim to plant over 1 lakh tress</strong>. What started as a humble initiative by a group of nature enthusiasts has now
                blossomed into a movement making a positive impact on the environment and local communities.

            <p class="animate-text">
                Our journey began with a simple yet powerful vision: <strong>to restore nature and combat deforestation by planting trees</strong>.
                Starting with a handful of volunteers organizing local community-based tree plantation drives, we faced numerous challenges.
                However, through perseverance, partnerships with local organizations, and the growing involvement of eco-conscious individuals,
                we have steadily grown over the years.
            </p>
            <p class="animate-text">
                Today, we proudly stand at over <strong>1 lakh trees planted</strong>, contributing to greener urban spaces, improved air quality,
                and enhanced biodiversity. We continue to push forward, believing that every tree planted brings us closer to a healthier and more
                sustainable planet.
